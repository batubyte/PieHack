## Hardware
### 1. Raspberry Pi Pico Models
- **[Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/boards-kits/raspberry-pi-pico-cat/raspberry-pi-pico-w.htm?sku=23108)**: Includes Wi-Fi, great for wireless hacking projects
- **[Raspberry Pi Pico 2W](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/boards-kits/raspberry-pi-pico-3/raspberry-pi-pico-2-w.htm?sku=29439)**: A newer version with bluetooth and more power

### 2. USB Cable or USB Adapter
- **[USB Cable (A to micro USB)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/usb-a-male-to-micro-usb-male-cable/)**: To connect your Pico to your computer
- **[USB Adapter (B to USB-C)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/usb-b-to-usb-c-adapter/)**: If you use a USB-C port

### 3. Power Source (Optional)
- **[Powerbank (Anker PowerCore 5000)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powercore-5000-mAh-Powerbank-A1109G11/dp/B01CU1EC6Y)**: To power your Pico when not connected to a computer (1.8V to 5.5V "3.3V recommended")

## Installation

### 1. Set Up Your Raspberry Pi Pico
- Download **MicroPython** or **CircuitPython** firmware.
- Plug in your Pico using the USB cable or adapter.
- Install **Thonny IDE** (for MicroPython) or **Visual Studio Code** for more advanced projects.

## Hacking Ideas

### 1. **USB Rubber Ducky (HID Attack)**
   - Turn the Pico into a fake keyboard that types commands automatically when plugged in.

### 2. **Wi-Fi Deauthentication**
   - Disconnect devices from Wi-Fi networks by sending deauth packets (requires an additional Wi-Fi module like ESP32).

### 3. **Bluetooth Hacking**
   - Use the Pico with a Bluetooth module to sniff Bluetooth traffic or test Bluetooth security.

### 4. **Keylogger**
   - Make the Pico log keystrokes by emulating a USB keyboard.

### 5. **Home Automation**
   - Control smart home devices by hacking IoT systems or building your own.

### 6. **Password Cracker**
   - Try cracking simple passwords by brute-forcing them with the Pico.

### 7. **Reverse Engineer USB Devices**
   - Sniff and analyze data from USB devices to understand how they communicate.

### 8. **Network Sniffer**
   - Capture and analyze network traffic using the Pico (with an Ethernet or Wi-Fi module).

### 9. **JTAG Debugger**
   - Use the Pico to debug other microcontrollers via JTAG for hardware hacking.

### 10. **Physical Security Hacking**

**Hardware:**
- **[Raspberry Pi Pico WH](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/?variant=raspberry-pi-pico-wh)**: The Pico with pre-soldered headers, great for prototyping and working with sensors or external hardware for security testing.
- **[Raspberry Pi Pico 2 WH](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/?variant=pico-2-wh)**: The newer Pico 2 with pre-soldered headers for easier connectivity and more powerful hacking projects.
- Control RFID locks or test security systems using the Pico.

## Ethical Considerations

Always follow ethical guidelines and get permission before hacking. Unauthorized hacking is illegal and unethical.
