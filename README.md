  A newer version with Bluetooth and enhanced power capabilities.

### 2. USB Cables & Adapters

- **[USB Cable (A to Micro USB)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/usb-a-male-to-micro-usb-male-cable/)**  
  Required to connect your Pico to your computer.

- **[USB Adapter (B to USB-C)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/usb-b-to-usb-c-adapter/)**  
  For connecting to USB-C ports, if that's your preferred setup.

### 3. Power Source (Optional)

- **[Anker PowerCore 5000 Powerbank](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powercore-5000-mAh-Powerbank-A1109G11/dp/B01CU1EC6Y)**  
  Use this powerbank to power your Pico without needing a computer connection. Supports 1.8V to 5.5V input (3.3V recommended for Pico).

## Installation

### 1. Set Up Your Raspberry Pi Pico

To get started with your Raspberry Pi Pico, follow these steps:

1. **Download the firmware** for either **MicroPython** or **CircuitPython**:
   - [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/)
   - [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)

2. **Plug in the Pico** to your computer using the USB cable or adapter.

3. **Install an IDE** for coding:
   - **Thonny IDE**: Recommended for beginners using MicroPython.
   - **Visual Studio Code**: For advanced users, particularly for larger projects and extensions.

## Hacking Ideas

### 1. **USB Rubber Ducky (HID Attack)**
   - Use the Pico as a *HID (Human Interface Device)* that emulates a keyboard, automatically typing commands when plugged in.

### 2. **Wi-Fi Deauthentication**
   - Disrupt Wi-Fi connections by sending deauthentication packets (additional hardware like an ESP32 may be required).

### 3. **Bluetooth Hacking**
   - Pair your Pico with a Bluetooth module to sniff Bluetooth traffic or test the security of Bluetooth devices.

### 4. **Keylogger**
   - Create a keylogger by emulating a USB keyboard and recording keystrokes.

### 5. **Home Automation**
   - Control smart home devices or create your own home automation system using the Pico.

### 6. **Password Cracker**
   - Implement brute-force attacks to crack simple passwords (use responsibly and ethically).

### 7. **Reverse Engineer USB Devices**
   - Capture and analyze data from USB devices to learn how they communicate and work.

### 8. **Network Sniffer**
   - Use the Pico (with Wi-Fi or Ethernet module) to capture and analyze network traffic.

### 9. **JTAG Debugger**
   - Use the Pico as a debugger for other microcontrollers through JTAG, helping with hardware reverse engineering.

### 10. **Physical Security Hacking**
   - Use the Pico to test physical security systems such as RFID locks, alarm systems, or access control devices.

## Ethical Considerations

While experimenting and learning with PieHack, itâ€™s crucial to always follow ethical guidelines:

- **Obtain permission** before attempting any hacking activity.
- Unauthorized hacking is illegal and unethical.
- Respect privacy and always conduct security research in a legal, responsible manner.
